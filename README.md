### Make sure:

Please make sure all the files have the rught permissions

chmod +x (filename)

for it to run via sudo

also make sure to make all your paths accessible via all machines.. I read somewhere in your code "G:/...." < remove this asap and make it a relative path

## How to run this?

Just run:

<pre><code>sh server.sh</code></pre>

In case you have issues and the project is not running and giving error related to paramiko and requests

then run the below command -

<pre><code>sudo apt install python-paramiko<code></pre>
<pre><code>sudo apt install python-paramiko<code></pre>
